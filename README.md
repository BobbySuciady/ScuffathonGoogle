# Scuffoogle - The Search Engine That Hates You

## 💀 What is Scuffoogle?
Scuffoogle is the world's first and only **search engine that actively dislikes you**. Instead of boring, friendly, and helpful results, Scuffoogle delivers your answers with **maximum sass and minimum patience**. If you've ever wanted a search engine that roasts you while doing its job, congratulations – you're in the right place.

### 🏆 Winner of the University of Melbourne's CISSA **Scuffathon Hackathon 2023** 🏆
Scuffoogle was so irritatingly brilliant that it *actually won* a hackathon. We took first place at the **Scuffathon 2023**, an event where developers compete to make the most ridiculous, absurd, and borderline useless tech imaginable. And yet, **here we are**, changing lives *one insult at a time*.
